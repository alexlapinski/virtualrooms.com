#Requirements

## Openness
 * Users must be able to get data whenever they want it
 * Users must be able to close account and remove data (all data from all rooms) whenever they want
 * Room Admins must be able to export all room data (and close/expunge) room data whenever they want it

## Security
 * Individual users have control over all their data
 * Individual users grant access to their data when entering a room (they grant the room permission to store any data generated in that room)
 * Room Admins must agree to user's security preferences (e.g. when user exits or requests data, a notice is sent to each room admin that user has generated content in, noting that the user requests data and/or requests deletion of data)
 * Since it won't always be possible to delete data generated in a room, the admin has the option of annyomizing the user, so that no personal information is stored, (user name replaced with 'anonyomous', face blured in video, etc). The data then remains in the room, and the user may download it.
 * Room admins grant access and visibility of all content created in a room to individual users and/or groups. Including a level of 'anomized content'
* No one can view content unless explicitly granted
